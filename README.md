# google-search [![GoDoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/rocketlaunchr/google-search?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/rocketlaunchr/google-search) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/rocketlaunchr/google-search)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/rocketlaunchr/google-search)

Quickly scrape Google Search Results.

‚≠ê **the project to show your appreciation.**

## Example

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"github.com/rocketlaunchr/google-search"
)

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()
	fmt.Println(googlesearch.Search(ctx, "optometrist"))
}
```

## Warning

The implementation relies on Google's search page DOM being constant. If it changes, then the implementation will break. Having said that, it hasn't changed for years.

In the event it changes, this package will be updated as soon as possible.
